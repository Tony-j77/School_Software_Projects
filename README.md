# School_Software_Projects

## High school computer science class assignments/projects 😎

This repo contains all the assignments/projects that I worked on during my high school computer science courses. Grade 10 has a focus on python while grade 11 and 12 focused on Java (more specifically iterative and recursive algorithims, dynamic data structures, linked lists, array lists and objective oriented programming ). 

# Project list:
### Grade 10: 
- Area of a triangle 
> Calculates the area of a triangle with given input
- Average jump distance
> Calculates the average of given inputs
- Sandwich 
> Subway simulator (asks the user for their optimally built sandwich and calculates price of sandwich given ingredients)
- Chessboard
> Draws a chessboard using Python Turtle
- Highscore
> Calculates the average of 2 scores
- How many coins
> Takes an input of amount of currency, returns the coin composition
- Items check
> Checks for the dimensions and weight of an object to confirm that they meet predefined criteria
- Mph to kph
> Converts miles per hour to kilometer per hour
- Payroll
> Calculates pay of employee given hours worked, overtime and taxes
- Triangle tessellation
> Prints a bunch of triangles in console... in a pretty manner.

### Grade 11:
- Bank, BankAccount, BankAccountGUI, BankAccountImproved
> functional bank account with deposit, withdraw and individual account balances with password protection
- ComboLock
> Turn on direction to a number, turn the opposite direction to another number, then turn to yet another number POP! lock is open
- Game of life
> Classic computer science project
- Sum of numbers
> Adds numbers in user-defined range by printing all numbber with "+" and concluding with "=" and the answer
- Triangle, Triangle classifier, TriangleUI
> Determine whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene with GUI
