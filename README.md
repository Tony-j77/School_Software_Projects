# School_Software_Projects

## High school computer science class assignments/projects 😎

This repo contains all the assignments/projects that I worked on during my high school computer science courses. Grade 10 has a focus on python while grade 11 and 12 focused on Java (more specifically iterative and recursive algorithims, dynamic data structures, linked lists, array lists and objective oriented programming ). 

## Personal favourite project:
### Connect 4 vs Adish

This was a final project that @Adke (my friend) and I did for our grade 11 computer science course. What we implemented was our version of the Connect 4 game where I am the bot tries to defeat the human player. 

The user will input their name and will choose the difficulty of the AI bot depending on their skill level from 1 to 5. After the user enters their name and difficulty, the program will initiate by showing a picture of Adish saying “Bring it on bud”. Then the gameboard will pop up allowing the user to click on a series of buttons at the bottom of the screen to choose where they want to place their game pieces, allowing the game to initiate. After the user has chosen where they want to place their game piece, the AI bot will process a bunch of algorithms like “for loops” and “if-else statements” to make his turn as well based on the difficulty that the user has selected. Once the game is finished, when someone has connected 4 game pieces together either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the system will show a pop-up message stating that the winner has won the game. If the real player won the game, a picture of the AI bot (Adish) will pop up saying “Sorry I am bad at Connect4” otherwise if the AI bot won, then it will say “Get Rekt Loser”.

Please note that the "Connect4.jar" file is given credit to Delos Chang for this project.
